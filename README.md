# Running Sorting Programs on Programiz.com

This guide explains how to execute each C++ sorting program using the **Programiz Online C++ Compiler**.

## Available Programs

- `bubble_sort.cpp`
- `selection_sort.cpp`
- `insertion_sort.cpp`
- `merge_sort.cpp`

Each file contains code to sort four test arrays (`Arr1`, `Arr2`, `Arr3`, `Arr4`) and measures execution time.

## Steps to Run on Programiz

1. **Navigate to Programiz C++ Compiler**  
   Open your browser and go to:  
   https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler

2. **Select a Program File**  
   - In the left‐hand file explorer, click the [+] icon to create a new file (if needed).  
   - Rename it to the desired filename (e.g., `bubble_sort.cpp`).

3. **Paste the Code**  
   - Copy the entire contents of `bubble_sort.cpp` from your repository.  
   - Paste it into the main code editor pane on Programiz.

4. **Compile & Run**  
   - Click the **Run** button (▶) at the top of the editor.  
   - The compiler will build and execute the code.

5. **View Output**  
   - The **Console** pane at the bottom will display:
     - The sorted arrays for Arr1 through Arr4.
     - Execution times in milliseconds.

6. **Repeat for Other Algorithms**  
   - Switch to `selection_sort.cpp`, `insertion_sort.cpp`, or `merge_sort.cpp` in the file explorer.  
   - Paste the corresponding code, then click **Run** again.

## Customizing Test Arrays

- To modify the arrays being sorted (e.g., change test values or sizes), edit the `Arr1`–`Arr4` definitions at the top of `main()` before running.

---

## Tips

- Ensure **all includes** (`<iostream>`, `<ctime>`) are at the top of each file.  
- Programiz uses a default C++17 compiler—no need for additional flags.  
- If you encounter timeout errors, reduce the size of your test arrays or remove timing code.

You’re now ready to run and observe the performance of each sorting algorithm directly in Programiz’s online environment!
